# Calendar

This is a Calendar for university students that have fluctuating times

In this project I aim to create a simple Calendar with the following rules

- Add Events
- Delete Events
- Have Reccuring Events
- Show Details of Event By `clicking` the Event
- The Calendar Must Show The Full Week
- Be Colour Coded According To Classes
- Be able to be converted to PDF and printed


This project will be coded in Python
